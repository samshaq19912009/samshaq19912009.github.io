# The k-means clustring algorithm

Given a training set ${x^{(1)},...,x^{(m)}}$, and we want to group the data into a few cohesive "clusters", **unsupervised learning**



1. Initialize **cluster centroids** $\mu_1, \mu_2,...\mu_k \in R^n$ randomly
2. Repeat until convergence: {

	For every i, set
		$$c^{i} := arg min_{j}||x^{i} - \mu_{j}||^2$$
	
	For each  j, set
		$$\mu_{j} := \frac{\sum_{i=1}^m 1\{c^{i}=j\}x^{(i)}} {\sum_{i=1}^m 1\{c^{i}=j\}} $$
	
	}

Is the k-means algorithm guaranteed to converge?

Define the **disotortion function** to be

$$J(c,\mu) = \sum_{i=1}^m ||x^{i} - \mu_{C^{(i)}}||^2 $$	

k-means is exactly coordinate descent on J. Specifically, the inner-loop of k-means min J with respect to c while holding $\mu$ the same, Then min J with repsect to $\mu$ holding c the same.

The distortion function J is a **non-convex** function. Not guaranteed to converge to the global minimum.
