## Image Classification


### Motivation

Assigning an input image one label from a fixed set of categories,one of the core problems in Computer Vision.

### Example

takes a single image and assigns probabilities to 4 labels, {cat, dog, hat, mug}. In this example, the cat image is **248 pixels wide**, **400 pixels tall**, and has three color channels Red,Green,Blue (or RGB for short). Therefore, the image consists of 248 x 400 x 3 numbers, or a total of **297,600** numbers.

### Challenges

### Data-driven approach. 

**Data-driven approach** : relying on first accumulating a training dataset of labeled images. Here is an example of what such a dataset might look like:

## Nearest Neighbor Classifier

* Train: no need to train,just memorize all the training data X_train, y_train

* Calculate the distance between each X_test and X_train

* Collect k most smallest y_train, do a majority to determine y_test


### The choice of distance:

L1-norm or L2-norm ?

$
d_2 (I_1, I_2) = \sqrt{\sum_{p} \left( I^p_1 - I^p_2 \right)^2}
$

### Vectorize your code!

#### Code 1: Compute distance with two loops: native solution

```Python
  def compute_distances_two_loops(self, X):
    """
    Compute the distance between each test point in X and each training point
    in self.X_train using a nested loop over both the training data and the
    test data.

    Inputs:
    - X: A numpy array of shape (num_test, D) containing test data.

    Returns:
    - dists: A numpy array of shape (num_test, num_train) where dists[i, j] 
    - is the Euclidean distance between the ith test point and the jth training
      point.
    """
    num_test = X.shape[0]
    num_train = self.X_train.shape[0]
    dists = np.zeros((num_test, num_train))
    for i in xrange(num_test):
        for j in xrange(num_train):
            dists[i][j] = np.linalg.norm(X[i]-self.X_train[j])


    return dists

```
#### Code 2: Compute distance with one loop-- not much faster

```Python
 def compute_distances_one_loop(self, X):
    """
    Compute the distance between each test point in X and each training point
    in self.X_train using a single loop over the test data.

    Input / Output: Same as compute_distances_two_loops
    """
    num_test = X.shape[0]
    num_train = self.X_train.shape[0]
    dists = np.zeros((num_test, num_train))
    for i in xrange(num_test):
        dists[i,:] = np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(self.X_train - X[i]),axis=-1))

    return dists
```

#### Code 3 Compute distance without loop -- much faster


```Python
  def compute_distances_no_loops(self, X):
    """
    Compute the distance between each test point in X and each training point
    in self.X_train using no explicit loops.

    Input / Output: Same as compute_distances_two_loops
    """
    num_test = X.shape[0]
    num_train = self.X_train.shape[0]
    dists = np.zeros((num_test, num_train))
    product = np.dot(X, self.X_train.T)
    test_sum = np.square(X).sum(axis=1)
    train_sum = np.square(self.X_train).sum(axis=1)
    dists = np.sqrt(-2*product + np.matrix(test_sum).T + np.matrix(train_sum))


```

#### Speed Compare

Two loop version took 23.563113 seconds

One loop version took 49.459447 seconds

No loop version took 0.311029 seconds
