# FP-growth Algorithm


## FP-trees: an efficient way to encode data

**Pros**: Faster than Apriori

**Cons**: Difficult to implement; certain datasets degrades performance

**Work with**: Nominal values

Unlike a search tree, an item can appear multiple times in the same tree. The FP- tree is used to store the frequency of occurrence for sets of items. Sets are stored as paths in the tree. Sets with similar items will share part of the tree. Only when they differ will the tree split. A node identifies a single item from the set and the number of times it occurred in this sequence. A path will tell you how many times a sequence occurred.

**General Approach**

1. Collect: Any method
2. Prepare: Discrete data is needed 
3. Analyze: any method
4. Train: Build an FP-Tree and mine the tree
5. Use: This can be used to identify commonly occurring items that can be used to make decisions, suggest items, make forecasts, and so on

## Build an FP Tree

### Initialize the FP-Tree data strcuture

Each tree node has several attributes: name, count, nodeLink, parent, and children.


```Python
class treeNode:
    def __init__(self, nameValue, numOccur, parentNode):
        self.name = nameValue
        self.count = numOccur
        self.nodeLink = None
        self.parent = parentNode      #needs to be updated
        self.children = {} 
    
    def inc(self, numOccur):
        self.count += numOccur
        
    def disp(self, ind=1):
        print '  '*ind, self.name, ' ', self.count
        for child in self.children.values():
            child.disp(ind+1)

```

### Constructing the FP-tree

Implement the header table to store the frequency of each itemset

Use the dictionary to store the header table. Also to keep track of the total count of every type of element in the FP-Tree


The main function to create the tree, given the dataset, first loop through the data and neglect non-frequent itemset.

Second through the dataset, update the tree with the header


```Python
def createTree(dataSet, minSup=1): #create FP-tree from dataset but don't mine
    headerTable = {}
    #go over the dataset Twice
    for trans in dataSet:
        for item in trans:
            headerTable[item] = headerTable.get(item, 0) + dataSet[trans]
    for k in headerTable.keys():
        if headerTable[k] < minSup:
            del(headerTable[k])
    freqItemSet = set(headerTable.keys())
    #return freqItemSet, headerTable
    if len(freqItemSet) == 0: return None, None
    for k in headerTable:
        headerTable[k] = [headerTable[k], None]
    return headerTable
    
    #create the Tree
    retTree = treeNode('Null Set', 1, None)
    #return freqItemSet
    for tranSet, count in dataSet.items():
        
        localD = {}
        for item in tranSet:
            if item in freqItemSet:
                localD[item]= headerTable[item][0]
                
                
        if len(localD) > 0:
            orderedItems = [v[0] for v in sorted(localD.items(), key = lambda p:p[1], reverse=True)]
            updateTree(orderedItems, retTree, headerTable, count)
    
    
    return retTree, headerTable
        
```

Two helpful function, one is the updateTree.

```Python

###Update the tree, add the node one by one

def updateTree(items, inTree, headerTable, count):
    if items[0] in inTree.children:
        inTree.children[items[0]].inc(count)
    else:
        inTree.children[items[0]] = treeNode(items[0], count, inTree)
        if headerTable[items[0]][1] == None:
            headerTable[items[0]][1] = inTree.children[items[0]]
        else:
            updateHeader(headerTable[items[0]][1], inTree.children[items[0]])
    
    if len(items) > 1: #call tree on the remaining ordered items
        updateTree(items[1::], inTree.children[items[0]], headerTable, count)


```

Another function to recursive find the node header

```Python

def updateHeader(nodeToTest, targetNode):   #this version does not use recursion
    while (nodeToTest.nodeLink != None):    #Do not use recursion to traverse a linked list!
        nodeToTest = nodeToTest.nodeLink
    nodeToTest.nodeLink = targetNode
```


## Mining frequenct items from an FP-Tree

1. Get conditional pattern bases from the FP-Tree
2. From the conditional pattern base, construct a conditional FP-Tree
3. Recursively repeat steps 1 and 2 on until the tree contains a single item



### Extracting conditional pattern bases


First function to ascend the tree

```Python
def ascendTree(leafNode, prefixPath): #ascends from leaf node to root
    if leafNode.parent != None:
        prefixPath.append(leafNode.name)
        ascendTree(leafNode.parent, prefixPath)
```

Secondly, find the prefixPath and find the conditional paths

```Python

##Given the base pattern
##find the conditional pattern bases
##Use like findPrefixPath('x', myheader['x'][1])

def findPrefixPath(basePat, treeNode): #treeNode comes from header table
    condPats = {}
    while treeNode != None:
        prefixPath = []
        ascendTree(treeNode, prefixPath)
        if len(prefixPath) > 1: 
            condPats[frozenset(prefixPath[1:])] = treeNode.count
        treeNode = treeNode.nodeLink
    return condPats

```

### Creating conditional FP-Tree

For each of the frequent items, create a conditional FP-Tree.

Then recursively find frequent items, find conditional bases and generate another tree


```Python

def mineTree(inTree, headerTable, minSup, preFix, freqItemList):

    bigL = [v[0] for v in sorted(headerTable.items(), key=lambda p: p[1])]#(sort header table)
    for basePat in bigL:  #start from bottom of header table
        newFreqSet = preFix.copy()
        newFreqSet.add(basePat)
        #print 'finalFrequent Item: ',newFreqSet    #append to set
        freqItemList.append(newFreqSet)
        condPattBases = findPrefixPath(basePat, headerTable[basePat][1])
        #print 'condPattBases :',basePat, condPattBases
        #2. construct cond FP-tree from cond. pattern base
        myCondTree, myHead = createTree(condPattBases, minSup)
        #print 'head from conditional tree: ', myHead
        if myHead != None: #3. mine cond. FP-tree
            #print 'conditional tree for: ',newFreqSet
            #myCondTree.disp(1)            
            mineTree(myCondTree, myHead, minSup, newFreqSet, freqItemList)


```

1.Starts by sorting the items in the header table by their frequency of occurrence.
2.Each frequent item is added into freqItemList
3.Recursively call findPath to create a conditional base and then fed into createTree() function
